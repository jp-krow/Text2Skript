/airdop setloot (Set the rewards that you can get from the airdrop.)\n#   /airdrop delete (This deletes every airdrop)\n#   /airdrop list (Sends you a list of every airdrop there is)\n#   /airdrop spawn (Spawns an airdrop)\n# Again you can feel free to dm me if you run into any problems.\n#------------------------------------------READ
